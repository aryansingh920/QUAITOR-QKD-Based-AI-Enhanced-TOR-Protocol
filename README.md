# QUAITOR

**QUAITOR** (Quantum AI-based Tor) is a next-generation secure communication protocol that combines the unbreakable security of **Quantum Key Distribution (QKD)**, the dynamic optimization capabilities of **Artificial Intelligence (AI)**, and the robust anonymity of **Tor's onion routing**. This protocol is designed to address the challenges of secure and anonymous communication in the post-quantum era.

## **Project Overview**

### **Purpose**

In an era where quantum computers pose a significant threat to classical cryptographic systems, QUAITOR introduces a revolutionary approach to secure communication. By leveraging QKD, AI, and Tor, it ensures:

1. **Unbreakable Encryption**: Quantum cryptography guarantees that encryption keys cannot be intercepted without detection.
2. **Dynamic Path Optimization**: AI intelligently selects network paths to optimize performance and avoid potential adversaries.
3. **Anonymity and Privacy**: Torâ€™s onion routing ensures user anonymity and resistance to traffic analysis.

### **Key Features**

1. **Quantum Key Distribution (QKD):**
   - Securely exchanges encryption keys between nodes using quantum principles.
   - Detects and mitigates any eavesdropping attempts.

2. **AI-Driven Path Selection:**
   - Dynamically selects optimal paths based on node reliability, latency, and security metrics.
   - Uses reinforcement learning and predictive models for real-time decisions.

3. **Onion Routing with Quantum Security:**
   - Encrypts messages in multiple layers using QKD-generated keys.
   - Ensures that no single node knows both the source and destination of the traffic.

4. **Post-Quantum Security:**
   - Resistant to attacks from quantum computers that could compromise classical encryption systems.

5. **Performance Optimization:**
   - AI balances security and performance, minimizing latency while maintaining robust anonymity.

## **System Architecture**

### **Components**

1. **Quantum Key Distribution Nodes (QKD Nodes):**
   - Perform key exchange using protocols like BB84 or E91.
   - Ensure that keys are securely distributed and refreshed for each session.

2. **AI-Enhanced Clients:**
   - Use AI models to select paths dynamically based on real-time metrics.
   - Optimize routes to avoid congested or malicious nodes.

3. **Onion Routing Nodes:**
   - Act as entry, relay, and exit points in the network.
   - Perform multi-layered encryption and decryption.

4. **Monitoring and Feedback System:**
   - Continuously monitors network performance and provides feedback to the AI path selection system.

## **Workflow**

### **1. Key Exchange Using QKD**
- Alice and Bob exchange symmetric encryption keys using quantum principles.
- The process ensures that any eavesdropping attempts are detectable and mitigated.

### **2. AI-Based Path Selection**
- The client collects metrics (e.g., latency, bandwidth, reliability) from available nodes.
- An AI model ranks nodes and selects an optimal path (entry, relay, and exit nodes).

### **3. Onion Routing with QKD Keys**
- Messages are encrypted in multiple layers using QKD-generated keys.
- Each node decrypts one layer and forwards the message to the next node.
- The exit node decrypts the final layer and sends the message to the destination.

### **4. Anonymity and Privacy**
- The combination of onion routing and dynamic path selection ensures that no single entity can trace the source, destination, or content of the message.
